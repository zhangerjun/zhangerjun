- 👋 Hi, I’m @zhangerjun
- 👀 I’m a PhD-trained biomedical researcher working on **neonatal diffusion MRI (dMRI)** methods and quantitative biomarkers for **preterm brain development and injury**.
- 🌱 What I do
  ** Diffusion MRI modeling: microstructure / spectrum-based modeling (e.g., DBM) and decomposition-based analysis  
  ** Neonatal neuroimaging pipelines:** QC, preprocessing, registration, atlas-informed ROI analyses, and segmentation  
  ** Machine learning: clinically robust analysis under low-SNR / constrained acquisitions
- 🌱 I’m currently working on Diffusion MRI modeling, Neonatal neuroimaging pipelines and use machine learning to segment neonatal brain structures;
- 🌱 I’m open to collaborations on diffusion MRI model applicatons, reproducible pipelines (Python) and translation to open-source tools;
- 📫 How to reach me: emails will be welcome (find email address on the left panel).
