- 👋 Hi, I’m @zhangerjun
- 👀 I’m a PhD-trained biomedical researcher working on **neonatal diffusion MRI (dMRI)** methods and quantitative biomarkers for **preterm brain development and injury**.
- 🌱 I’m currently working on dMRI models and decomposition methods;
- 🌱 I’m currently recruiting colaborators about machine learning algorithm development;
- 📫 How to reach me: emails will be welcome (find email address on the left panel).

### What I do
- **Diffusion MRI modeling:** microstructure / spectrum-based modeling (e.g., DBM) and decomposition-based analysis  
- **Neonatal neuroimaging pipelines:** QC, preprocessing, registration, atlas-informed ROI analyses, and segmentation  
- **Machine learning:** clinically robust analysis under low-SNR / constrained acquisitions

### I’m open to collaborations on
- dMRI modeling & quantitative biomarkers for neonatal / pediatric cohorts  
- Segmentation-informed analyses (weakly supervised / limited labels)  
- Reproducible pipelines (Python) and translation to open-source tools
